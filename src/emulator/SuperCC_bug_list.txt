SuperCC bug list:

Priority: Cosmetic
1. Invalid tiles don't always show- Floor/Thin Wall shows no indication that a tile is buried there, among others.

Priority: Medium-High
3. Blue and Green buttons added via the cheat menu will cause a Null Pointer exception when pressed via any means

Things MSCC does but TW and SuCC don't:
Priority: Low-Medium
1. https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Tank_Top_Glitch

Fixed Bugs:

Priority: VERY High (Mainly fixed)
1. TWS reading sometimes desyncs for TWSes with mouse moves, resulting in moves after the mouse move being offset by [1/2]
(desyncs a lot of mouse routes)

Priority: Low
2. Block/Block results in a block being flicked. Intended behavior: treated as Block/Floor, erasing the lower block when pushed, except when the attempted push is out of a teleport, which results in flicking the top block off of the lower block.

Priority: Low
3. Block/Clone Machine should clone a block in the pushed direction.

Priority: Cosmetic-Medium
4. Collecting 10 keys of 1 colour then rewinding or restarting and collecting more of that same key causes the key digit to glitch out (line 79 of GamePanel.java, something to do with the j variable)

Mouse issues (All fixed):

Mouse bug 1 (Fixed):
If a mouse move is made via boosting so it occurs on the first half of the turn it doesn't add a half wait after the move like it should and allows for an erroneous extra move that turn
(cclp4 68, down then up then click up left of Chip, should add a half wait after but doesn't)

Mouse bug 2 (Not a bug, intended behaviour under MSCC):
Currently: second mouse move cancels first mouse move
What should happen: first move executes, the second move the next turn unless canceled by something within that next turn
